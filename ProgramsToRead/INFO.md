# Hello, World!
This part of the repository is here for you to read the programs and try to recreate or see **how my logic works**.
If you want to chat or write some code please send me a message!
(Most of them are from the course *'Aprendendo Python'* of the channel on youtube: __*'Curso em Video'.*__
Check out for more informations!)
## PS: everything is in PT-BR, and is a basic knowledge.
