Hey, this part of the repository is here for you to read the programs and try to recreate or see how my logic works.
If you want to chat or write some code please send me a message!
(Most of them are from the course 'Aprendendo Python' of the channel on youtube: 'Curso em Video'.
Check out for more informations!)
PS: everything is in PT-BR.
